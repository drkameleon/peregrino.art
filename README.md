### What does this package do?

This is a benchmarker tool to help you measure and compare different scripts, in an ultra-customizeable way, see the results in an intuitive way and... even export them (Json & Markdown supported so far!) in case you want to keep them for further processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Peregrino has shamelessly been inspired by a tool I personally love: [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine). See it mostly as a double personal challenge: a) see how easily this could be done in Arturo, using what we already have, and... b) make something even better and more user-friendly!

### How do I use it?

Peregrino comes in a *hybrid* package; that is: you may use it as a library (via `import`), or you can actually run it via the command-line, after installing it.

#### As a library

```red
import {peregrino}!

P: to :peregrino @["command one", "command two"]!
P\benchmark ; and that's it!
```

#### From the terminal

When properly installed, you should be able to run Peregrino as any normal command, directly from your terminal.

A brief preview of all the options (identical to the output of `--help`):

```
Usage:
    peregrino [options] <command>,...

Arguments:
    <command>
        One or more commands you want to benchmark

Options:
    -r, --run <times>           Specify number of times to run each command 
    -f, --file                  Read commands from text file (one per line) 
    -p, --params <string>       Use custom params in command 

    -m, --minimal               No fancy output; just the data! 
    -a, --ascii                 Use simple style, with ASCII-only characters 
    -c, --colorless             Don't use colored output 

        --markdown <file>       Export Markdown to given file 
        --json <file>           Export Json to give file 

    -h, --help                  Show this help screen 
    -v, --version               Print version 
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Arturo - and thus Peregrino - use the Nim-inspired way of parsing command-line params. Thus, for setting the `--run` param, you should use `:` before the value, e.g.:
> ```
> peregrino --run:10 "some command" "another command" ...
> ```
